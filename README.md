# Rust Project

This project follows the conventions of a Rust project and includes error management using the `Result` type and the `match` construct.

## Installation and Execution

1. Ensure you have Rust installed. If not, download and install Rust from [Rust official website](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

2. Open a terminal or command prompt.

3. Navigate to the project directory.

4. Build and run the project:

    ```bash
    cargo build
    cargo run
    ```

## Coding Standard

This Rust project follows common Rust coding standards for maintaining a consistent coding style [style](https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.0.0/style/README.html).

## Usage

To run the program, execute the compiled binary:

```bash
./target/debug/rice_cooker
```

## Additional Notes

- This project uses the `read_line` function for user input and the `delay` function for pausing execution. These functions are implemented to match the behavior of the TypeScript code.

- The Rust code includes proper error handling using the `Result` type and the `?` operator for propagating errors.

- If you encounter any issues or have questions, refer to the official [Rust documentation](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn) for help and guidance.

Feel free to explore and modify the Rust code to suit your needs. Enjoy using Rust for your project!
